# Blogstrap, for GitHub Pages

This is a [Jekyll](http://github.com/mojombo/jekyll)-powered blog hosted
on [GitHub Pages](http://pages.github.com/). This Getting Started template is
based on [Zach Holman's blog](http://zachholman.com).

## The design

While the structure of this blog is a great start, you'll need to put some of
your own creativity into the design to make it your own. To get started, you
should search the code for "TODO" - this will tell you where you need to make
changes.
